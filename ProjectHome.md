## Mission ##

To give people the tools they need to exercise [informed consent](http://www.nvic.org/informed-consent.aspx), by [comparing vaccines](http://cdowney68.wordpress.com/projects/vaccine-quick-view/) and creating customized Vaccination Plans.

## Vision ##

Informed consent can be best summarized as: show us the science and give us the choice.

Thinking like consumers means that we behave more like we would if we were buying a car: we do research, compare brands, examine safety records, and look under the hood.  What exactly is in this vaccine?  How do the ingredients compare with known safety standards?  What is the total amount of ingredients if we take more than one vaccine during an office visit?  Am I okay with injecting these ingredients in these amounts into myself or my children?

We can also use the VIC to choose one brand of vaccine over another or insist upon a preservative free version, taking the Vaccine Record print out with us to the doctor's office or health clinic to reinforce our choices with data and to manage our own health records.

If we choose to vaccinate, we can create our own alternative schedules to minimize the amounts of ingredients (mercury, aluminum, etc.) injected at any one time.

## Ethics ##

This project fully embraces the [informed consent ethic](http://www.nvic.org/informed-consent.aspx).  We do not take a pro-vaccine nor an anti-vaccine stance.

## Disclaimer ##

This open source project produces the Vaccine Ingredients Calculator software for the [National Vaccine Information Center](http://www.nvic.org/) in order to support a great cause; however, our mission, vision, ethics and anything else is found on this website has not been endorsed by NVIC.  The only thing NVIC has endorsed is the software found on the [production website](http://www.vaccine-tlc.org/).  Major new versions go through substantial reviews by NVIC before being deployed.  If you download the in-development software found here, please keep in mind that it is not endorsed by NVIC and almost certainly contains some errors.
