## Ingredient Questions ##

**PersonWithQuestion:**  Do you know how many types of vax in the childhood schedule do NOT have aluminum?

**me:**  let me check...

**PersonWithQuestion:**  I think rotavirus is one

**me:**  No alum: RV, polio, flu, MMR, varicella, MCV (meningococcal)
Might say Hib, too, since PedVaxHib has been recalled (per FDA website)...  2 out of 3 Hib vaccines have no alum

**PersonWithQuestion:**  Thx!  Is Pediarix the highest with 850mcg?

**me:**  Another way of looking at it is across ALL vaccines and ALL schedules, alum is found in approx 40% of vaccines<br><br>

<b>PersonWithQuestion</b>  Or is it Pentacel?<br>
<br>
<b>me:</b>  Pediarix has 850 mcg of alum<br>
<br>
<b>PersonWithQuestion:</b>  That is DTaP, HepB and Hib?<br>
<br>
<b>me:</b>  No - DTaP, HepB and polio<br>
By doing individual shots of DTaP, HepB and polio, one can reduce alum exposure to 420 mcg<br>
But you'd need to request specific brands of vaccines (or else the number easily jumps up 50%)<br>
<br>
<b>PersonWithQuestion:</b>  Thx.  Will check in later<br>
<br>
<b>PersonWithQuestion:</b>  What's the range of Al dose?  With 850 being the highest.<br>
<br>
<b>me:</b>  125 in Prevnar<br>
you'll find a wide range in-between -- no clear/obvious pattern<br>

<h2>Ingredient Stats</h2>

50.9% of the full CDC schedule contains formaldehyde<br>
<br>
<BR><br>
<br>
<br>
29.8% of the full CDC schedule contains thimerosal<br>
<br>
<BR><br>
<br>
<br>
40.4% of the full CDC schedule contains aluminum<br>
<br>
<BR><br>
<br>
<br>
19.3% of the full CDC schedule contains polysorbate 80<br>
<br>
<BR><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"contains" includes "trace" amounts - let me know if you think these<br>
kind of stats are interesting and, if so, what other ones you'd like<br>
to see.  I'm going to have all of this info in a database and we'll be<br>
able to get all kinds of fascinating data<br>
<br>
the more you can challenge me for data, the better our database will<br>
be.   A challenge might be something like showing the thimerosal<br>
numbers broken down into trace amounts and what "types" of<br>
vaccines tend to have thimerosal (type = flu, DTaP, etc)<br>
<br>
I like the thimerosal challenge piece.  Can it be applied to aluminum speciation and poly 80?
