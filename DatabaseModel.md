One of the most important design assumptions (not yet built into the model) is that all vaccines are versioned. For example, there are 3 different brands of DTaP.  If the aluminum in Infanrix decreases, this new formulation is recorded in the VID as a new version (hence, a new vicId).  This will enable us to track ingredient changes over time.  Each vicId (see Vaccines table) requires a date, which should be pulled from the package insert.
